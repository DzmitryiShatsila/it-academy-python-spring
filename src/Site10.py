# 10) A cipher grille is a 4Ã—4 square of paper with four windows cut out.
# Placing the grille on a paper sheet of the same size, the encoder writes down
# the first four symbols of his password inside the windows (see fig. below).
# After that, the encoder turns the grille 90 degrees clockwise. The symbols
# written earlier become hidden under the grille and clean paper appears inside
# the windows. The encoder then writes down the next four symbols of the
# password in the windows and turns the grille 90 degrees again. Then, they
# write down the following four symbols and turns the grille once more. Lastly,
# they write down the final four symbols of the password. Without the same
# cipher grille, it is difficult to discern the password from the resulting
# square  comprised of 16 symbols. Thus, the encoder can be confident that no
# hooligan will easily gain access to the locked door.
